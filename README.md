# FHNW (ipro) Indoor Climate
FHNW (ipro) is a mandatory individual software project, worth 6 ETCS.

> Note: Work in progress. Interested? Contact thomas.amberg@fhnw.ch

## Overview
In [this project](http://www.tamberg.org/fhnw/2025/hs/IproIndoorClimate.pdf) you will use CO2 sensors to measure indoor climate.

## Levels
To keep you motivated, this project template is split into levels.

- [x] Level 0: [Getting started](level-0/README.md)
- [ ] Level 1: [Logging sensor data](level-1/README.md)
- [ ] Level 2: [Analyzing your data](level-2/README.md)
- [ ] Level 3: [Monitoring remotely](level-3/README.md)
- [ ] Level 4: [Scaling up and out](level-4/README.md)

## Results
Each level results in a working prototype, built from building blocks.

## Goals
Goals describe what to achieve, in order to complete a level/result.

## Building blocks
Each building block shows how to solve a specific, small issue.

## Side quests
Each level has side quests, things to try, directions to explore.

## Language
You choose as you like, we provide Python and Java examples.

## "AI" tools
> Note: No "AI" is needed, you're welcome to learn / think for yourself :)

If you use [prompts](prompts), save them, e.g. for code [based on](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-ipro-indoor-climate/blob/main/level-1/Python/csv_write/csv_write.py#L2) a [prompt](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-ipro-indoor-climate/blob/main/prompts/2025-08-29T09-45-00Z.txt).
